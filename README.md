```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Key configuration parameters can be adjusted in the `config.py` or `app.py` file:

- **Model Path**: Location of LLaMA 2 model files
- **Temperature**: Controls response randomness (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum length of generated responses
- **Port**: Server port (default: 5000)

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Model Parameters

Modify response behavior by adjusting these parameters:

```python
temperature = 0.7  # Lower for more focused responses
max_tokens = 512   # Increase for longer responses
top_p = 0.9       # Nucleus sampling parameter
```

### Adding Custom Legal Context

You can enhance LexBot's legal knowledge by:
- Fine-tuning the model on specific legal documents
- Implementing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for legal databases
- Adding custom prompts for specific legal domains

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## üêõ Known Issues & Troubleshooting

- **High Memory Usage**: LLaMA 2 requires substantial RAM. Consider using the 7B parameter model for machines with limited resources.
- **Slow Response Times**: First-time model loading may take time. Subsequent responses should be faster.
- **GPU Support**: For faster inference, ensure CUDA is properly installed if using GPU acceleration.

## üìù Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for multiple LLaMA 2 model sizes
- [ ] Implement conversation history and context management
- [ ] Add document upload for legal document analysis
- [ ] Integrate vector database for enhanced RAG capabilities
- [ ] Mobile-responsive UI improvements
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Export chat history functionality
